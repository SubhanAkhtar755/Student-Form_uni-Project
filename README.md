## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhanAkhtar755/Student-Form_uni-Project.git
   cd Student-Form_uni-Project


Open the folder in VS Code or any editor.

Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console

Add your Firebase config to the JavaScript file (usually app.js or main.js):

const firebaseConfig = {
  - apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  - authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  - projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  - storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  - messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  - appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};


Run the app — simply open index.html in your browser.
