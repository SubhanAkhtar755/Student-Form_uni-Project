#  Student Form – University Mini Project

A simple web-based student management app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Firebase Firestore**.  
This project was created as a **pre-final year university mini project** to practice CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Firebase.

##  Features

-  **Add Student** — Enter first name, last name, gender, email, phone number, and password  
-  **Edit Student** — Update student information directly from the interface  
-  **Delete Student** — Remove any student entry from the database  
-  **View Students** — Display all student records as interactive cards  
-  **Firestore Integration** — All data is stored and managed in Firebase Firestore  
-  **Instant Updates** — Real-time data synchronization without page reloads

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhanAkhtar755/Student-Form_uni-Project.git
   cd Student-Form_uni-Project


Open the folder in VS Code or any editor.

Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console

Add your Firebase config to the JavaScript file (usually app.js or main.js):

const firebaseConfig = {
  - apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  - authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  - projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  - storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  - messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  - appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};


Run the app — simply open index.html in your browser.
